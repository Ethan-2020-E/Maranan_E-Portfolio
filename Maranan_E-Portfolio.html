<td style="font-size: 150%"> Hi! I am Ethan Haley Maranan, the twelfth boy in the section Fairness.  I am probably known as one of the quiet students in the class.  In my opinion, elephants are the BEST animals in the world, not only they are cute but elephants are caring creatures who have a strong bond with their family.  My hobbies are listening to music while studying and playing video games with my friends.  During this school year, I will strive to do my best and embrace all the challenges I receive to build a better version of myself. </td>

<font size="5" color="cyan"> Online Activity in ICT (Creating an HTML with a hyperlink) (click on the image ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) </font> <br> 
This task was done during the suspension of classes when we were assigned to create an html code filled with hyperlinks. <br> <br> <br> <br>

<font size="5" color="cyan"> Performance Task in Art (Stained Glass) </font> <br> 
Our third performance task in Art.  This is a mock version of stained glass art which is an art form made from colored glass originating in the 7th century and is mostly seen in churches.  We were assigned to form groups of 3 in creating this performance task. <br> <br> <br> <br>

<font size="5" color="cyan"> Group 3 Health MV "Mundong Lupa" </font> <br> 
This is one of the last performance tasks to be submitted before the first quarter ends.  There were some unseen and deleted footage that were not on the actual video due to having nowhere to put it.  Nevertheless, we had fun filming even during the rainy days. <br> <br> <br> <br>

<img src="ApInteractive.jpg" alt="Interactive Notebook" width="800" height="600"> <br> <br>
<font size="5" color="cyan"> First Quarter Interactive Notebook in AP </font> <br> 
This notebook is filled with interactive pages.  It merges the creativity of a student and the content of our lessons.  This is by far one of the most difficult and time-consuming task this whole quarter. <br> <br> <br> <br>

<video controls> <source src="Conditionals.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video> <br> <br>
<font size="5" color="cyan"> Performance Task in English </font> <br> 
We were tasked to create a song based on the type of conditionals assigned to us. <br> <br> <br> <br>

<font size="5" color="cyan"> Performance Task in Science (Human Simulation of the Cardiovascular System) </font> <br> 
This performance task involves acting as the parts of the heart and lungs to present the path of the blood as it goes through the circulatory system and how oxygen travels through our body.  Our group decided to put a twist, a twist which shows how a virus interacts with our cardiovascular system.  This is one of the activities I enjoyed and we all got a perfect score. <br> <br> <br> <br>

<b> <font size="7" color="cyan"> ü™ûReflection for 1st Quarterü™û </font> </b> <br>
<font color="#FFEF77" size="5"> It is the start of the 9th grade, which means a new chapter has begun in my journey.  It was a relief for me to know most of my classmates from the get-go.  I expected this school year to be as rough as a rock, but with the correct habits in mind, things went more smoothly as time passed.  Struggles in time management were mainly prevalent during this quarter, so I will try to fix that and learn from any mistakes I have made.  I would say that our section improved in many ways, although we are probably still the noisiest. <br> <br>  

I enjoyed learning during ICT classes.  We had fun while still acquiring the skills of becoming a skilled web developer.  I can apply the knowledge I absorbed to our performance tasks and the future.  Tables and Lists help me organize information as a learner.  Forms help us determine what to improve about our work.  If I earn a job in the future, utilizing these HTML codes will help promote businesses or management to the world with access to the internet.  These websites may help boost the popularity of franchises, sales, or your social being. <br> <br>

Overall, learning all these computer techniques and HTML codes will be efficient in our lives.  </font> <br> <br>
